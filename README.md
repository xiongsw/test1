*
* 1) SPH_Poisson_C (using Eclipse+MinGW, c-code)
 * (for Poisson Equation: good) (But for Bearing lubrication: not open to public)
 *This code was developed on the basis of theoretical works:
 *1)S.Kulasegaram, Development of particle based meshless method with applications in metal forming simulations.
 *               Doctor Thesis, University of Wales, 1999.
 *2)C.S.Li, S.W.Xiong, J.M.C.Rodrigues, P.A.F.Martins. ‘Simulation of Metal Forming Processes by Meshless Methods’.

 * 2) car_insurance1 (using Eclipse+MinGW, c++ code)
 *// This program is used to calculate 6-month policy for vehicle insurance
*// a particular car's value, the number of accidents and residence sub-charges.
